YTwipsy YUI3 Tooltip
====================

What is it?
-----------

YTwipsy is a tooltip for the YUI3 Library. It is built to replicate the functionality of Twipsy, the popular tooltip used in Twitter's Bootstrap. 


What features does it have?
---------------------------

YTwipsy is built as a Y.Node plugin and it's goal is to be as lightweight as possible. It doesn't subclass Y.Widget because it doesn't need most of that code. Over time, I'll try to make it as small as possible, both in terms of JS and CSS.

Currently it supports the following:
	- Placement of tooltip above, below, left or right of content
	- Offset support (how far the tooltip should be from the content)
	- Ability to set placement and tooltip content through data-attributes on DOM elements
	- Customizable triggers (events that should show or hide the tooltip)
	- Animation (no customization yet)
	- The cool "tip" that points to the content
	- Totally skinnable
